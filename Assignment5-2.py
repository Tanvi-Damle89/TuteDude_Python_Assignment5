# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Step 1: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Step 2: Extract the first five elements
first_five = numbers[:5]

# Step 3: Reverse the extracted list
reversed_list = first_five[::-1]

# Step 4: Print both lists
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("First five elements:", first_five)
print("Reversed first five elements:", reversed_list)
